This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Environment variables are defined in `./.env.local` file. You need to create an `.env.local` file in the root directory before run

`.env.local` contains three environment varibales:
1. `BACKEND_URL`      # the address of the backend server
2. `DATABASE_URL`     # the connection string of the database
3. `POST_DB`          # the name of the database in which posts are stored

Example of `.env.local` file:

```.env.local
BACKEND_URL="http://localhost:3001"
DATABASE_URL="mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017"
POST_DB="posts"
```
If you have not added backend url to the system environment variables, please set them in .env.local:

```.env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL="https://backend.example.com"
```

### run in docker

1. First, install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
2. build and run docker container

<!--  docker build -build-arg API_URL=http://localhost:8000 -t moral-front-end . -->
```bash
docker build --build-arg FRONTEND_PORT=3000 -t moral-front-end .
docker run -p 3000:3000 moral-front-end
```

### run in local

1. First, install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and npm (npm will automatically installed with node.js).

â€‹	Add node and npm to path.


2. Try the following command to see if you've installed node and npm correctly.

```bas
node --version
npm --v
```

3. Run the following command to install the dependencies:

```ba
npm install
```

4. Run server at development mode:

```bash
npm run build
npm run dev             
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `page.tsx` or `layout.tsx` in app folder. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.



## Project Structure

`/app` : Routing folder, this is where you organize routes and degisn the layout for each route.

`/components`: Store reusable UI components that can be used throughout the application

`/lib`: Store reusable utility functions, custom hooks, and other non-component modules that supports the main application functionality.

`/public`: Store static assets such as images, fonts, and static files.

`/package.json`: Node.js configuration file.
